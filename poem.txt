My Poem

Broken to pieces, for I was messed up
and now I am standing singing to myself
The rain was falling, more than before;
and through the curtain, I saw your face:
lighting my mind like the moon in the dark:
you made me fall harder than I thought;
darkness would make you its queen,
light its goddess, or be a piece of my heart.
