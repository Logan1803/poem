My Poem

Broken to pieces, for I was messed up
and now I am standing here in this rain,
falling down hard, harder than before;
Through the curtain, I saw your face:
lighting my mind like a flash out of the blue:
you made me fall hard, harder than I wanted;
But I just stood there, frozen in time,
For I was surprised, that I met you.
the world will make you its queen.
waging wars to gain your favour
But take a piece of my heart.
for I insist, it feels like its yours
You'd never know what you'd find,
a perfect fit for yours.
