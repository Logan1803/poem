My Poem

Broken to pieces, for I was messed up
and now I am standing here in this rain,
falling down hard, harder than before;
Through the curtain, I saw your face:
lighting my mind like a flash out of the blue:
you made my heart fall, so hard that it broke;
But I just stood there, frozen in time,
For I was surprised, that I met you.
the world, oh! it will make you its queen.
waging wars to gain your favor
But take a piece of my heart.
for I insist, it doesn't feel like mine
You'd never know what you'd find,
something to hold yours together, maybe?
